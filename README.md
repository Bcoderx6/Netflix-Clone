Continuous Integration (CI) Setup:

Utilize GitHub Actions for automated CI workflows.
Set up a CI pipeline to trigger on code pushes to the main branch.
Define workflow steps for building the application and running tests.
Code Analysis with SonarQube:

Integrate SonarQube for code quality analysis and static code analysis.
Configure SonarQube to analyze code for bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells.
Include SonarQube analysis as a step in your CI workflow using the SonarQube GitHub Action.
Security Scanning with Trivy:

Implement Trivy for security scanning of Docker images.
Include Trivy scanning as part of your CI/CD pipeline to ensure container security.
Set up Trivy to scan for vulnerabilities in dependencies and system libraries.
Deployment on DigitalOcean:

Utilize DigitalOcean cloud infrastructure for hosting your application.
Set up deployment scripts or configurations for deploying the application on DigitalOcean droplets.
Use Docker for containerization and Docker Compose for managing multi-container environments if applicable.
CI/CD Workflow Steps:

Define specific steps in your CI/CD workflow, such as:
Cloning the repository and fetching dependencies.
Building the frontend and backend components.
Running unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests.
Performing SonarQube code analysis and Trivy security scanning.
Building Docker images and pushing them to a Docker registry.
Deploying the application to DigitalOcean droplets using deployment scripts or tools like SSH and Docker.
